``USER``:
    *frecklecute* is built on top of `Ansible <https://ansible.com>`_, and the ``USER`` keyword refers to an `Ansible module <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/modules.html>`_. An 'Ansible module' is a basic building block that manages a single component on a system, in an idempotent way. That means, however often you run that task with the same configuration on the same machine, that machine's state will always be the same after every such run (if the task doesn't fail, of course). This is a very important concept in configuration management, as otherwise you could not be sure about the state your machine is in after your run.

    Ansible ships with a `ton of such <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_all_modules.html>`_ modules, and there is one for every task imaginable. In our example, we are referring to the `user module <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/user_module.html#user-module>`_. The 'user module' is a fairly basic and central one that is often used, and which helps to manage every aspect of a user account on a system. We are using it here to create a new user. Actually, to be exact, we are using it to ensure that a certain user account exists on our system. This is the idempotency-thing I was talking about earlier: if the user exists already, this will not error out or do anything extra. This removes a lot of exception handling and similar boilerplate we would have to do otherwise (e.g. in a shell script).
